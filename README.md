# DSA Visualizer

Welcome to **DSA Visualizer** – an interactive platform to visualize Data Structures and Algorithms in real-time.

This project aims to make learning DSA easier and more intuitive by providing clear, step-by-step visualizations of key data structures and algorithms. Whether you're working with arrays, linked lists, trees, or graphs — this tool helps you understand the underlying logic through dynamic animations and user interactions.
